distributed:
  worker:
    # Fractions of worker memory at which we take action to avoid memory blowup
    # Set any of the lower three values to False to turn off the behavior entirely
    memory:
      target: 0.60  # target fraction to stay below
      spill: 0.80  # fraction at which we spill to disk
      terminate: 0.95  # fraction at which we terminate the worker
      pause: 1.0  # fraction at which we pause worker threads
